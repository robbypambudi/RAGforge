# 🔨 RAGforge

**RAGforge** is a production-ready template for building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications using:

- 🐍 **Python**
- 🔗 **LangChain**
- 🟣 **ChromaDB** (for vector storage)
- 🐘 **PostgreSQL** (for metadata and structured data)

This project provides a modular, extensible foundation for quickly prototyping or deploying RAG pipelines. Designed for developers, researchers, and teams building LLM-powered apps that require fast, context-aware information retrieval.
